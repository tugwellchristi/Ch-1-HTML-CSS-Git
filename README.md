# Front End Code Refactor

## Project Description
This project focused on taking existing front end code and refactoring it to be more accessible and inclusive for all users, accommodating needs for certain disabilities and the use of assistive technologies, such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. The reworked code includes more semantic HTML elements and provides better ease of navigation.
